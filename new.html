          <span>My Dearest,</span>
          <br />
          Iâ€™ve been thinking a lot about us lately, and I wanted to put my feelings into words because sometimes itâ€™s easier to write than speak. Iâ€™m sorry if this letter feels like a lot, but I need you to know whatâ€™s been on my heart.

First of all, I want you to know how much I love you. Thatâ€™s the most important thing I need to say. You mean the world to me, and thereâ€™s not a day that goes by when I donâ€™t think about you. But recently, it feels like thereâ€™s been a wall between us, and Iâ€™m not sure how to break through it.

When I text you and donâ€™t hear back, or when I call and donâ€™t get an answer, it leaves me feeling confused, hurt, and frustrated. I know Iâ€™m not perfect, and maybe I havenâ€™t shown you the love and care you truly deserve. If Iâ€™ve let you down in any way, Iâ€™m deeply sorry. I realize now that I could have been better, more understanding, more attentive. You deserve nothing less than the best, and Iâ€™m sorry if I havenâ€™t given you that.

I guess what Iâ€™m trying to say is that I miss youâ€”miss talking to you, laughing with you, and just knowing that weâ€™re okay. If Iâ€™ve made you feel like I donâ€™t care enough or that I donâ€™t love you enough, please know thatâ€™s not true. I love you more than words can say. But I also know that love alone isnâ€™t always enoughâ€”we have to show it in our actions too.

I just want a chance to make things right, to prove to you that Iâ€™m committed to this relationship, to us. Please let me know whatâ€™s on your mind. If thereâ€™s something Iâ€™ve done or something I can do better, I want to know. Iâ€™m willing to fight for us, but I need to know if youâ€™re still with me in this fight too.

Iâ€™ll always care for you, no matter what. Youâ€™ve got a place in my heart that no one else can ever fill. All Iâ€™m asking for is a chance to reconnect, to talk, to understand whatâ€™s really going on.

With all my love.
